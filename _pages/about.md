Welcome to my website! I am a research scientist in the [Mechanical Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University.](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu)

I am a proud French-Canadian <img src="[image.jpg](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/pch/images/services/flags-francophonie/drapeau_franco_n_b-francophonie_n_b_flag.jpg)" alt="Flag" width="50">.
 
I obtained my Ph.D. at Dalhousie University, where I worked alongside [Jeff Dahn](https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html). During this work, I studied the impact of new electrolyte additives and different state of charge range on the cycling performance and properties of lithium cells. I also learned the basics of density functional theory (DFT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Prior to that, I got my M.Sc. at Universit√© de Moncton on the theoretical modeling of the Casimir effect.
 
After my Ph.D., I joined the [Obrovac Research Group](https://www.dal.ca/sites/obrovac.html) as a research assistant, where I studied anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. That's where I learned additional experimental techniques such as XRD and SEM.
 
After that, I joined the [Venkat Viswanathan's Electrochemical Energy Group](https://eeg.engin.umich.edu) (now at the University of Michigan) and later the [Jay Whitacre Research Group](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/whitacre/index.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu) as a post-doctoral fellow where I developed nuclear magnetic resonance, electrochemical, and computational methods for Lithium-ion cell monitoring, mitigation, and prediction.

I am currently a research scientist at the [Laboratory for Transport Phenomena in Energy Systems](https://www.cmu.edu/me/tpes/) working with [Shawn Litster](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/litster-shawn.html) to improve performance of fuel cells.
 
Aside from research, I am also passionate about all fields of science, science communication, and the arts.
