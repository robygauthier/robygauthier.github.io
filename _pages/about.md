# Welcome to my website!  

I am a proud French-Canadian <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robygauthier/robygauthier.github.io/master/assets/img/Flag_of_New_Brunswick.svg" width="60" style="margin-left: 10px;" />   

I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics at Dalhousie University, where I worked alongside [Jeff Dahn](https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html). During this work, I studied the impact of new electrolyte additives and different state of charge ranges on the cycling performance and properties of lithium cells, while also learning the basics of density functional theory (DFT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Before that, I earned my M.Sc. at Université de Moncton on the theoretical modeling of the Casimir effect, which rooted my curiosity in the fundamentals of physics.  

After my Ph.D., I joined the [Obrovac Research Group](https://www.dal.ca/sites/obrovac.html) as a research scientist, where I studied anode materials for lithium-ion batteries and gained further expertise in XRD and SEM. Later, I worked with the [Venkat Viswanathan Electrochemical Energy Group](https://eeg.engin.umich.edu) (then at CMU, now at the University of Michigan) and the [Jay Whitacre Research Group](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/whitacre/index.html) at [CMU](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu) as a post-doctoral fellow. There, I developed nuclear magnetic resonance, electrochemical, and computational methods for lithium-ion cell monitoring, mitigation, and prediction.  

I am currently a research scientist at the [Laboratory for Transport Phenomena in Energy Systems](https://www.cmu.edu/me/tpes/) working with [Shawn Litster](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/litster-shawn.html) to improve performance of fuel cells.
