Welcome to my website! I am a battery researcher and physicist interested in better understanding the failure mechanisms and the bulk electrolyte properties of lithium-ion batteries.
 
I obtained my Ph.D. at Dalhousie University, where I worked alongside [Dr. Jeff Dahn](https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html). During this work, I studied the impact of new electrolyte additives and different state of charge range on the cycling performance and properties of lithium cells. I also learned the basics of density functional theory (DFT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
 
Prior to that, I got my M.Sc. at Universit√© de Moncton on the theoretical modeling of the Casimir effect.
 
After my Ph.D., I joined the [Mark Obrovac lab](https://www.dal.ca/sites/obrovac.html) as a research assistant, where I studied anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. That's where I learned additional experimental techniques such as XRD and SEM.
 
Recently I joined the [Venkat Viswanathan group](https://www.cmu.edu/me/venkatgroup/) as a Post-doctoral fellow, where I continue trying to understand degradation and electrolyte properties using both experimental and theoretical techniques.
 
Aside from battery research, I am also passionate about all fields of science, science communication, and the arts.
